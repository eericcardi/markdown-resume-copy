# Resume Building Instructions for Derek Hildreth

## 1. Start With a Clear Goal
- Every resume must serve a **specific purpose** (e.g., Staff+ engineer role, founder positioning, industry pivot).
- Maintain one **master resume** with everything included, then trim/tailor for each application.

## 2. Keep It Human and Authentic
- Avoid hype words, cliches, and corporate fluff.
- Write in a **straightforward voice** that reflects values: integrity, meaningful work, service, excitement, connection.
- Represent strengths honestly.
  - Example: "Comfortable working with TypeScript in production, though strongest in PHP."
  - Do not claim expertise unless you could confidently teach it.

## 3. Structure and Formatting
- Target **2 pages maximum** (3 only for exceptional cases like publications).
- Use the following order:
  1. Header (Name, location, email, GitHub/LinkedIn)
  2. Professional Summary (short, values-forward, highlights principal engineer and founder role)
  3. Core Skills (grouped by categories)
  4. Professional Experience (reverse chronological)
  5. Founder Experience (LookOver deserves its own section)
  6. Selected Projects / Publications (if space allows)
  7. Education / Certifications (last)

## 4. Writing Experience Bullets
- Use the formula: **What you did + How you did it + Why it mattered**.
- Example: "Designed and implemented data pipelines normalizing ad spend across 20+ social platforms, enabling accurate pacing, invoicing, and commissions for millions of dollars in media spend."
- Focus on measurable outcomes and business impact, not just duties.

## 5. Authentic Skills Positioning
- **Strongest areas**: PHP (Laravel), backend systems design, distributed data, local-first/offline-first, Supabase, AI-assisted features, leadership.
- **Comfortable but not deep expert**: TypeScript, React Native.
- **Emerging narrative**: Staff+ leadership, AI-assisted development, powersports SaaS founder.

## 6. Tailoring Per Application
- Mirror job post language when relevant.
- Highlight different aspects depending on company type:
  - Healthcare: emphasize meaningful work.
  - SaaS: emphasize scalability and product impact.
  - Powersports: emphasize founder experience and community alignment.
- Cut less-relevant tech when space is limited.

## 7. Show Core Values
- Subtly weave values into bullets and summary:
  - Integrity: "Ensured data accuracy and transparency in reporting pipelines."
  - Service: "Mentored engineers through code reviews and pair programming."
  - Excitement: "Launched LookOver app, helping riders stay on the trail instead of in the garage."

## 8. Version Control
- Maintain resume in **Markdown or plain text** for easy edits.
- Export to PDF for applications.
- Save tailored versions by target company (e.g., `Resume-SaaS.pdf`, `Resume-Healthcare.pdf`).

## 9. Regular Maintenance
- Update every 6 months or after major achievements.
- Capture fresh wins from LookOver (growth, partnerships, feature launches).
- Include professional milestones (interviews, promotions, certifications).

## 10. Final Polish
- Proofread carefully. Avoid em dashes. Keep punctuation simple and clean.
- Ensure white space for readability.
- Use a modern, readable font when exporting (e.g., Calibri, Helvetica, Source Sans Pro).

## Writing Style Rules
- Never use em dashes (these are AI writing tells).
- Keep tone conversational and authentic, not artificially polished.
- Use simple punctuation: commas, periods, colons.
- Avoid corporate buzzwords and cliches.
- Be direct and technical without being dry.
