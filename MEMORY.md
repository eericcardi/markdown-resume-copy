  - Embedded systems (Technologic Systems)
  - Enterprise software (Oracle)

### Personal Context

## Current State

Derek recently accepted a Staff Software Engineer position at Skylight Digital, a civic tech consultancy working on HHS contracts, after extensive research and salary negotiation. The role represents a strategic move to gain production TypeScript experience while contributing to meaningful government digital modernization work. He successfully negotiated the offer from $195,000 to his target range.

At his current role with General Indemnity Group, Derek has been leading backend system consolidation, migrating from dedicated VMs to AWS infrastructure, and introducing engineering best practices like TDD and CI/CD.

### AWS Experience
EC2, ECS, RDS, S3, CloudFront, Route53, CloudFormation, CloudWatch, IAM, Lambda, SQS, EventBridge, Secrets Manager, and ElastiCache. Note: lacks blue-green deployment experience.

## Key Learnings and Principles

### Truth Over Hype
Derek prioritizes truth over hype in all professional communications. He received feedback that interview responses stayed too high-level without clearly demonstrating specific individual technical contributions. This led to a core principle: only claim verified experiences and ask for clarification rather than fabricate expertise when job requirements are unclear.

### Authentic Storytelling
Authentic storytelling resonates more than overwhelming employers with credentials. Most effective cover letters lead with confident qualification statements followed by punchy, memorable 2-4 sentence stories that demonstrate genuine research and personal connection to the company's mission.

### Professional Demeanor
Values "grounded humility with positive energy," being useful over impressive, empowering others rather than hoarding authority, and creating psychological safety. His natural tendency to "go along to get along" and avoid conflict needs active management in professional settings.

### Strategic Career Planning
PHP/Laravel expertise, while deep, can be a barrier to opportunities at companies using different tech stacks. The strategic move to Skylight Digital specifically addresses this by providing production TypeScript experience to open doors at preferred outdoor tech companies.
