## About Emily Riccardi

Emily is a Knowledge Operations Manager, actively job searching for Staff+ level positions at mission-driven companies. Her company was recently acquired by Bending Spoons, which has a history of performing mass layoffs. She has 10+ years of experience working in Customer Support organizations, specifically in maintaining support content for both internal and exteranl audiences, content taxonomy, 

### Core Values
Derek values competence, autonomy, cooperation, honesty, and flexibility above all else.

### Work History
- Had a hybrid working arrangement from 2016-2020. Works remotely since 2020. 
- Started in Customer Support at Livestream in 2013. Moved to a product specialist role, responsible for maintaining help center, user manual, and training new employees on all Livestream software and hardware products.
- Livestream acquired by Vimeo in 2017. Moved into Documentation Manager role (later renamed to Knowledge Management Analyst II), managing all support content: internal SOPs in Confluence, support macros (canned replies) in Zendesk, and help center content (Zendesk Knowledge).
- Obtained manager role after vacancy opened up in 2021. Team grew to global workforce of 4 in total. Leadership had us focus only on customer-facing self-service experience started in 2023.

### Personal Context
Emily is a wife and a mother of a toddler girl, which influences her work-life balance priorities and values around authentic, supportive workplace cultures. Emily lives in Suffolk County, Long Island, which would make a daily commute New York City difficult and costly. 

### Job Search Focus
A remote position is preferred, but a hybrid role in New York City or Long Island would be acceptable if the salary is right. Alternatively, on-site positions located on Long Island can be considered. On-site roles in New York City should not be considered due to cost and time commitments for commuting.

Companies with strong missions that align with her values:
- B2B SaaS
- Video tools and technology
- Education technology
- News and media outlets

## Current State

**tktktkt fill in after BSP decision.**

At her most recent role at Vimeo, Emily has been leading a global team of four Knowledge Management Analysts. In recent years, they've been focusing on improving customer-facing self-service experience. They do this by:
- Closely collaborating with product, engineering, marketing, and legal teams when releases are imminent, including architecting what that collaboration process looks like and continuously improving it in partnership with Program Management
- Automated article verification cycles (i.e. if a specified amount of time has passed since the last edit, an article gets marked as "unverified.")
- Collecting and reviewing both employee and customer feedback on help center articles
- Regularly scheduled touch points with SMEs
- Weekly, monthly, and quarterly review of help center and chatbot performance metrics to gain actionable insights
- Dedicated team review of one randomly selected article per week for content standard adherence
- Facilitated CMS and chatbot migrations in partnership with development teams and vendors; translated business needs into technical requirements to be executed by staff or vendor engineers
    - Chatbot migration led to a 10% increase in deflection. The team validated through testing that answers to a variety of questions were more clear and accurate in the new chatbot compared to the old chatbot.
    - All CMS/knowledge base migrations were successful, with no loss of assets, broken links (i.e. 301 redirects), and no interruption in access to the help center for customers

## Key Learnings and Principles

### Truth Over Hype
Emily prioritizes accuracy and clarity over hype in all professional communications. Only claim verified experiences and ask for clarification rather than fabricate expertise when job requirements and qualificatio matches are unclear or uncertain.

### Authentic Storytelling
Authentic storytelling resonates more than overwhelming employers with credentials. Most effective cover letters lead with confident qualification statements followed by punchy, memorable 2-4 sentence stories that demonstrate genuine research and personal connection to the company's mission.

### Professional Demeanor
Values "grounded humility with positive energy," being useful over impressive, empowering others rather than hoarding authority, and creating psychological safety. 

### Strategic Career Planning
While Emily has people management experience and isn't opposed to people leader roles, an individual contributor role with strategic influence would be more appealing. Emily is currently at a crossroads in her career, where "Knowledge Management" or "Knowledge Operations" roles are likely the closest fit. However, much of her experience also closely aligns with roles such as Technical Writer, Documentation Manager, Content Manager, Content Strategist, Help Center Manager, Digital Support, or similar. She would also be interested in Program Manager roles that reference Knowledge, Customer Support, CX, or similar terms.
