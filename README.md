## AI-Assisted Resume Building

This project includes configuration files for AI assistants to help generate consistent, high-quality resumes and cover letters. Two key files power this:

- **CLAUDE.md** - Rules and instructions for how to write resumes
- **MEMORY.md** - Context and background information about the person

### Example Prompts

Once your AI assistant has access to your rules and memory, generating a tailored resume is simple:

```
Tailor my resume to the [Job Title] position at [Company Name].

[Paste the job description here - formatting doesn't matter]
```

The AI will use your master resume, project memory, and instructions to automatically select relevant skills and experiences that match the job description.

For more control, add specific talking points:

```
Tailor my resume to the Staff Software Engineer position at Outdoor Tech Co.

Things to highlight:
- My experience building offline-first mobile applications
- The React Native work I did with LookOver
- I'm drawn to their mission of getting people outside
- My AWS infrastructure experience, especially Lambda and ECS

[Paste job description]
```

You can also request a cover letter in the same prompt:

```
Tailor my resume and write a cover letter for the Senior Backend Engineer role at HealthTech Inc.

For the cover letter, mention:
- My family's experience navigating healthcare systems
- Why meaningful work matters to me
- My track record with data pipeline reliability

[Paste job description]
```

### Integrating with Claude Code (CLI)

Claude Code automatically reads `CLAUDE.md` files in your project directory. Simply run `claude` in this directory and the rules will be applied.

### Integrating with Claude.ai (Web)

1. Start a new conversation or use a Project
2. Copy the contents of `CLAUDE.md` and `MEMORY.md` into the system prompt or project knowledge
3. Or paste both files at the start of your conversation with a prompt like:

```
Here are my resume writing rules and background. Please use these for all resume and cover letter generation:

[Paste CLAUDE.md contents]

[Paste MEMORY.md contents]
```

### Integrating with ChatGPT

**Option 1: Custom GPT**
1. Create a new Custom GPT at chat.openai.com/gpts/editor
2. In the "Instructions" field, paste the contents of `CLAUDE.md`
3. Upload `MEMORY.md` as a knowledge file
4. Save and use your custom GPT for resume generation

**Option 2: Per-Conversation**
1. Start a new conversation
2. Paste both files at the beginning:

```
I'm going to share my resume writing rules and background information. Please follow these guidelines for all resume and cover letter work in this conversation.

RULES:
[Paste CLAUDE.md contents]

MY BACKGROUND:
[Paste MEMORY.md contents]
```

### Integrating with Other AI Tools

Most AI assistants support custom instructions. The general pattern is:

1. **System prompt / Instructions**: Use `CLAUDE.md` contents to define how the AI should write
2. **Context / Knowledge**: Use `MEMORY.md` contents to provide background information
3. **Keep files updated**: As your experience grows, update `MEMORY.md` to keep AI-generated content accurate

### Discover Your Values First

Before writing your resume, it helps to know what you actually value. This system emphasizes authentic, values-driven storytelling rather than generic corporate language. If you're unsure what your core values are, take the free assessment at:

**[Think2Perform Values Assessment](https://www.think2perform.com/values/)**

Once you know your values (integrity, service, connection, excitement, etc.), you can weave them naturally into your resume bullets and professional summary. This creates a more authentic document that attracts companies aligned with who you actually are.

### Customizing for Your Own Use

1. Fork this repository
2. **Identify your values** using the Think2Perform assessment above
3. Replace `MEMORY.md` with your own background, experience, and preferences
4. Modify `CLAUDE.md` to match your resume style and formatting rules
5. Use the master-resume.md as a template for your comprehensive experience

## Troubleshooting

**PDF not generating?**
- Check that `md-to-pdf` is installed: `npm install -g md-to-pdf`
- Verify file paths are correct (use absolute paths)

**Styling not applied?**
- Ensure `.css` and `.json` files are in the same directory as the script
- Check that file contains valid markdown
- Verify the config file path is correct

**Cover letter using resume styling?**
- Ensure filename contains "cover-letter", "cover_letter", or "letter"
- Or manually specify: `md-to-pdf file.md --config-file cover-letter-config.json`

**Content overflowing 2 pages?**
- Remove less relevant bullet points
- Shorten descriptions
- Combine related achievements
- Consider removing older roles
